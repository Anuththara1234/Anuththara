The server and the client make up the internet connection. The connected device is the client while the server is not connected physically to anything but virtually to the internet service provider. The IP address is the device’s address and every server needs to have one to exist. The data center is where you find several servers.

These servers receive the client request on which they respond accordingly. The domain name is mandatory to access the internet as it consists of the IP address number. They are difficult to remember but not for the computer. The Domain Name server has a list of all the registered IP numbers which allows computers to find them very easily.

To make it simple, when the user searches for anything online, the browser is sending a request to the DNS for the IP address. Once the IP address is sorted, the browser reaches the respective server completing the search. The server then accepts the request resulting in the flow of data. The optical fiber facilitates data transfer in digital form from one device to another.

There is a connection between the router and the fibers allowing the conversion of light signals into electric ones. This transmission is by the ethernet cable allowing users to get the needed information. In the case of wireless networks, the signal reaches the cell tower first in the form of electromagnetic waves.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers of the USA manages the internet, IP address allocation, domain name registration, and more.
